#Observations
1. autosave helps with TDD
2. git revert will replace commenting out code if used correctly - YAGNI (You ain't gunna need it)
3. git reset HEAD~1 --hard -> removes last commit
4. changing if to while was cool
5. auto-run for tests? (there is a shortcut for run last tests) 
6. liked having the huddles -> pause and get ideas out there from a couple times
7. No flailing -> less chipping in/navigator asks
8. I liked shorter turns more (Evan)
9. Ideal Mob/Ensemble -> 4
10. Easy way to switch driver/navigator
11. Mobbing -> really good for learning

   5a. More planning would have helped/requirements clearer defined
   5a. Priorize tests for certain patterns etc
6. Green is very motivating
